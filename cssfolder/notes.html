    Positioning: 
        Each element in our document has a position property. 
        This specifies how the element should be arranged in our document.
        The positions we'll learn here are: - static - relative - fixed - absolute - sticky
        Reletive - almost like a margin
                   position: reletive;
                   left: 40px;
                   top: -10px;
        fixed - will always stay in that position
        absolute - will overlap an element z-index: 2;
        sticky - 

    Layouts:
        Flex - this will put all my elements in a row across the screen
        flex - directon-row or colum
        flexNesting- 
        align-items:flex-center, flex-start, flex-end;
        justify-content: flex-end, flex-start;
